# Custom CLI

This is a personal project made to make my CLI life easier. Its just basic cmd, but with some custom commands built into it. If you would like to add your custom command to it, feel free to clone it.

Any improvements or criticism is appreciated :)

Also, this will not work on your system, as I have the file paths for applications as per my system. So when you clone it, make sure to put in your file paths.
